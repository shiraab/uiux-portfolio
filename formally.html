      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://formally.us/home'>Formally</a> is a startup based in Palo Alto, CA, whose mission is to help
        asylum seekers get the legal help they need. Founded in 2018, the company
        arose out of the clear need for both good client-management and <b>form-filling software</b> for attorneys,
        and <b>reliable, easy-to-understand information on the immigration process</b> for asylum seekers.
        This need has become especially dire
        during the Trump presidency and, more recently, during the socially-distanced
        pandemic era.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the grandchild of refugees and the daughter of US immigrants, I believe
        strongly that every immigrant is worthy of dignity. As a result, my time
        at Formally felt incredibly purposeful and meaningful – even on days when I was fighting
        with CSS to get a hamburger menu to animate properly.
      </p>
      <div class='image-card'>
        <img src='./jank-burg.gif' alt='gif of a hamburger menu animation gone wrong'/>
        <p>A hamburger-menu-to-be – unfortunately, a little off-kilter.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        On paper, my role at Formally was as a <b>Frontend Web Developer</b>. In practice,
        I spent my days both developing component upon component in React, and
        doing other "odd jobs" such as content writing, research, and backend work –
        whatever needed doing on any particular day.
      </p>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        I was asked to focus on redoing Formally's homepage and navigation experience both
        on Web and on Mobile,
        as well as creating an all-new workflow to help users navigate complex
        processes through USCIS.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
        This writeup will focus on the redesign of the homepage from ideation all the way
        to launch!
        </b>
      </p>
      <h3>Process Overview</h3>
      <p>
        My priority for the summer was revamping as many components as I could, which included
        working with a designer to finalize designs, doing research into policy issues,
        writing content for web pages and new components, and creating "magic" in user interactions. For the
        homepage project, this meant creating an all-new mobile menu (think hamburger!), a new footer,
        and writing content for the homepage.
      </p>
      <p>For the homepage, our development process went as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Research & content writing</li>
        <li>Design discussions</li>
        <li>Implementation</li>
        <li>Review & Iteration</li>
        <li>Launch!</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Research & Content Writing</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage project was part of a branding effort on Formally's part. The old
        homepage dated from 2018 and was in dire need of a revamp. As a result, our designer
        was hard at work creating a new site – but she needed new content before she could
        finish the design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working closely with the co-founders, I rewrote every text on the homepage, ranging
        from the introductory "Why Formally?" element to the marketing blurbs explaining
        how the site works. Because I had already been with Formally for over a month when the
        homepage project started, I was already somewhat familiar with Formally's core
        functionality and the visions that the founders have for its future – but that
        isn't what a homepage has to communicate. My research therefore focused on the following
        questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What issues are most important to attorneys who use Formally?</li>
        <li>What issues are most important to asylum seekers who use Formally?</li>
        <li>What do other sites highlight on their homepages?</li>
        <ul><li>What about other sites that help users find immigration assistance?</li></ul>
      </ul>
      <p>My answers were as follows:</p>
      <h4>What issues are most important to attorneys who use Formally?</h4>
      <p>
        Attorneys' most scarce resource, I discovered, is <b>time.</b> Immigration
        litigation is often thankless work, and some of the people most in need never
        get legal aid because attorneys simply don't have the time to manage the number
        of cases they receive.
      </p>
      <p><i>Key Takeaway 1: Highlight Formally's time-saving potential, so lawyers understand
        how Formally can help them.</i></p>
      <p>
        They're also suspicious of software that claims to reduce personnel or otherwise
        make the immigration process more "efficient," and with good reason. Legal systems
        are all about people – it's impossible to take lawyers out of them.
      </p>
      <p><i>Key Takeaway 2: Make sure to highlight lawyers' important work, so that
      attorneys know that Formally isn't here to replace them, but rather to help them
      do their jobs more easily! </i></p>
      <h4>What issues are most important to asylum seekers who use Formally?</h4>
      <p>
        The process of seeking asylum in the US is long and complicated – and unfortunately,
        there are a lot of people who are willing to take advantage of people's pain, including
        the U.S. Government. Asylum seekers are rightfully wary of being tracked, or of making
        a wrong move by accident, and many fear their information falling into the wrong hands.
      </p>
      <p><i>Key Takeaway 1: Highlight Formally's strong security and data privacy.</i></p>
      <p><i>Key Takeaway 2: Take a compassionate tone – make it clear that we're here to help.</i></p>
      <h4>What do other sites – immigration-related and otherwise – highlight on their pages?</h4>
      <p>In a survey of a number of other sites' homepages, I discovered that many had the following features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A catchy slogan on a splash image</li>
        <li>Testimonials and/or awards</li>
        <li>A description of how the product works</li>
        <li>A mission statement</li>
        <li>Calls to action throughout the page</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>Key Takeaway 1: Include a list of awards Formally has won on the front page.</i></p>
      <p><i>Key Takeaway 2: Describe key features of the product in each blurb.</i></p>
      <p><i>Key Takeaway 3: Include testimonials wherever possible, especially if they come with calls to action!</i></p>
      <p>After clarifying these key takeaways, I wrote and rewrote the short blurbs to make them as snappy
        and tonally consistent as possible, iterating on each piece of text with the founders' help.
        Once we finished writing the site copy, we were ready to finalize the design and
        move on to development.
      </p>
      <h3>Design discussions</h3>
      <p>
        Even during the research process, I met with our UI/UX designer routinely to clarify
        which parts of the design were most important, and which new features were a priority
        from her perspective. Before building the final site, we settled on a "minimum viable product"
        or "first iteration" design together:
      </p>
      <div class='image-card'>
        <img src='./formally-homepage.png' alt='exported Figma page displaying page regions'/>
        <p>Design by <a href='http://www.brianadas.com/'>our designer.</a> Annotations by me.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>Implementation occurred in four parts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Building the new navigation bar</li>
          <li>Building the new footer</li>
          <li>Building a proprietary carousel</li>
          <li>Finishing the homepage!</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Navigation bar</h4>
        <p>
          The navigation bar had already been in the works before we made the homepage.
          Most of the implementation centered on the mobile version, which has a hamburger menu
          which I made myself. Lesson learned: effective UX takes a lot more work than importing new components!
        </p>
        <div class='image-card'>
          <img src='./navbar-redesign.gif' alt='demonstration of new hamburger menu'/>
          <p>Demo of hamburger menu during development</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Footer</h4>
        <p>
          The new footer was much more straightforward than the navbar, but likewise had to be
          re-implemented to be responsive.
        </p>
        <h4>Carousel</h4>
        <p>
          This was the most challenging part of the homepage. I experimented with lots of
          different animation libraries in the hopes of making the carousel more responsive –
          but eventually settled on the good old "margin modifying" method.
        </p>
        <h4>Final touches</h4>
        <p>
          Once we were done with the more complex UI elements, I translated
          the rest of our agreed-upon design into the new hopepage.
        </p>
      <h3>Review & Iteration</h3>
      <p>
        When I submitted my GitHub PR, we touched up a few issues on content, but
        the homepage was done! The seamless submission process was made possible by
        all our discussions and thoughtful planning before implementation – it really
        does help to do as much thinking and working as possible before starting to code.
      </p>
      <h3>Launch!</h3>
      <p>
        Just a few days after I finished my product, Formally's new homepage was
        officially launched! The site is fully responsive – and I think it's pretty beautiful. Take a look!
      </p>
      <iframe src='https://formally.us/home' title='Formally'></iframe>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        The process of creating Formally's homepage was a perfect example of how
        many discrete elements are required for a project to really work. I used to think
        that, because they're mostly static pages (that is, their content doesn't
        require extensive computation), homepages are the simplest
        to build. Having been involved in the content writing and design discussions, not to
        mention creating my own custom components for the site, I now fully appreciate
        the labor involved in making a homepage as intriguing and eye-catching it needs to be
        in order to effectively "pitch" the app to a potential client.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the time I spent at Formally was incredibly meaningful. As I mentioned
        in the overview, my grandparents were refugees – my great-grandparents were turned
        away as they tried to flee genocide, simply because they did not have the proper visas.
        My parents, too, are immigrants, and my own citizenship comes from the 14th Amendment, which
        grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.
        Formally is giving more immigrants the chance at a fair trial at the border, and it's been an honor
        to play a part in making that happen.
