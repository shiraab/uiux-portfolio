        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>
          According to
          <a href="https://g3ict.org/headlines/new-report-finds-majority-of-websites-in-the-u-s-are-inaccessible">
            a recent report by Deque,
          </a> almost 70% of websites
          in the US do not meet even basic
          elements of the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,
          </a> today's
          gold standard for web accessibility. Even
          <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/07/dominos-supreme-court.html">
          major restaurant chains,
          </a>
          <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/beyonces-parkwood-entertainment-sued-1172909">
            public figures,
          </a> and
          <a href="https://time.com/5675691/2020-election-candidates-website-disability-accessibility/">
          presidential campaigns
          </a>
           have websites that
          remain inaccessible to blind and low-sighted users.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the reason for this is twofold: people a) don't know
          what accessibility guidelines are and b) they don't understand
          why they are important. I get it: I used to be one of these
          people. It took me a serious concussion, during which I used
          screen readers to access the internet, to actually start caring.
        </p>
        <p>
          It shouldn't have.
        </p>
        <p>
          For that reason, I've created this site to be as accessible as
          I can. I built and designed it using basic HTML/CSS/Javascript. Here
          are some features and development practices I've included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Skip links</li>
          <li>ARIA landmarks</li>
          <li>Dynamic text resizing</li>
          <li>Strong color contrast</li>
          <li>Descriptive page elements</li>
          <li>Heading structure</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Still, I know that accessibility is a process, so
          please reach out if you are having any issues
          accessing this site, or if you have questions about how to make
          your site more accessible! Remember:
